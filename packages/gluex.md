# Task Title

Unlocking Yield Optimization with GlueX Yields API

## 1. Problem Statement

APY volatility is huge. This means, there is a very big opportunity for strong yield optimization services that can reallocate lending positions across HyperEVM markets. Users should get the best sharpe for their capital, i.e. highest yield at lowest risk.

## 2. Goal / What to Build

Use GlueX Yields API and GlueX Router API for off-chain yield optimization and ERC-7540 or BoringVault for on-chain custody to build a yield optimizer protocol.

## 3. Core Requirements (Acceptance Criteria)

List **exactly what must be working** for the task to be considered complete.

- [ ] ERC-7540 or BoringVault to custody assets and restrict the vaults with which the optimizer can interact.
- [ ] Use GlueX Yields API to identify the highest yield opportunity at the given moment.
- [ ] Use GlueX Router API to reallocate the assets to the highest yield opportunity.
- [ ] Include GlueX Vaults in the set of whitelisted vaults among which capital is allocated.

## 4. Deliverables
